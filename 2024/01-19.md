## Minutes

Johann Hofmann: \
 Started rolling out the 1% 3PCD experiment in early Jan (timeline here: https://privacysandbox.com/open-web/). We hope to expand the rollout further with approval from the CMA. You can report breakage using the instructions here (https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/blog/cookie-countdown-2023oct#report-issues). There is also a Deprecation Trial available (instructions here: https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/blog/third-party-cookie-deprecation-trial) . We’re also preparing a 1st party version of this, where first parties can apply with a set of 3rd party domains. The deprecation trial does not apply for ads use cases.

Steven: Is it the case that a lot of IVT companies that are cross site, they are more reliant on other APIs than third-party cookies? Or is 1% not a large enough population that you are seeing issues right now? \
 \
Johann Hofmann: There are some antifraud companies who have applied for deprecation trials. \
 \
Kaustubha Govind: Local storage is also impacted by this rollout. We started partitioning storage a few months ago, and we are running a DT for that as well. Please reach out if you are seeing a degradation signal fidelity, and we have tools that can be used to audit your sites (https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd/prepare/audit-cookies).

Steven: Would folks also be interested in hearing about Shared Storage in this forum? Polls aren't working =(.

Ranjita: What is the rest of the community doing for ad fraud detection, because it’s very dependent on third-party cookies? What other solutions and patterns exist? \
 \
Eric Trouton: This is something I’d like to hear about today. After speaking to several partners, what I’ve heard is that cookies are not exceedingly useful because they are so easy to clear. We’ve also heard of folks using derived signals from cookies. \
 \
Steven: Some folks have been using variations of CHIPS to mitigate 3P cookie use cases. I’m getting some private messages so the chairs will try to put something together. \
 \
Jordan Ross: From a google ads traffic quality perspective, we’re experimenting with using these APIs. Concern on the Protected Audiences side datacenter traffic: 

Issue:[ https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/982](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/982) \
 \
Eric: We’re looking into datacenter denylists for other projects, but this is something we’re interested in exploring further.
